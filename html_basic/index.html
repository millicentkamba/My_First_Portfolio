    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This is my personal portfolio where I will showcase my projects and progress as I learn web development.</p>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This webpage is part of my ALX HTML basics project. It includes paragraphs, headings, and a clickable image.</p>

    <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
    <p>I am learning how to work with Git, GitHub, HTML, and other web development tools. This is one of the first pages I've built.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my page. More content will be added soon as I continue developing my skills.</p>
